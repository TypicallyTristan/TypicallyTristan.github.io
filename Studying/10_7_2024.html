        <h1>Studying for 10/7/2024</h1>
        <p>Today I finished module 3 of Googles Cybersecurity Profesional Course. The main topics covered were frameworks such as CIA and NIST as well as security code of ethics.</p>
        
        <p>I also finished a lesson in the Ram Module of Mike Meyer's A+ Core 1101 Udemey course. I learned how to spot the difference between SD and DDR1 through DDR4 ram sticks. One important not I tooks is that the pc speed rating is the DDR speed rating multiplied by 8. 
        </p>

        <p>From my personal project of builing a virtual homelab envoirment I learned quite a bit actually. I've gone from knowing absoulutely nothing about homelabbing to understanding the basic idea of it. I've also made some decent progress in learning Active Directory.</p>

        <p>Overall this was a pretty succesful first day of fully commiting to learning!</p>
