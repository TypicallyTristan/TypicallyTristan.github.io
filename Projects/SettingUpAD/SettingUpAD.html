        <h1>Setting Up Active Directory</h1>

        <h2>For this project I will be setting up active directory between two virtual machines. </h2>

        <p>First start with downloading the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022" target="_blank">Windows Server 2022</a> iso file and a<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank">Windows 10</a> iso file. These will be used for the Domain Controller and the Client virtual machines.</p>

        <!-- <p>-----------------</p>

        <p>-----------------</p> -->

        <p>Once you have these two files downloaded, creat the two virtual machines through <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Oracle Virtual Box</a>. You can name the two machins whatever you wish but for this instance they will be namded DC, domain controller, and Windows Client respectively </p>
        <p>Now that you have both of your virtual machines created, you first want to go into settings under network for the Client and set adapter 1 to internal. Then go into settings/network for DC and changed adapter 2(not 1!) to internal. With these two aspects finished you can now launch the DC virtual machine.</p>

        <p>During the set up choose Desktop Experience in order to have a GUI. Depending on the specs you allocated the set up may take some time. Once the set up is finished, you will have to unlock the virtual machine by going into input at the top, selecting keyboard/ctrl+alt+delete. You can now put in your password you chose during set up.</p>

        <p>Now, before anything you also want to go into devices at the top and select Insert Guest Additions CD Image. Then open file explorer and open the AMD file of Guest Additions. This will make for a much smoother experience.</p>
