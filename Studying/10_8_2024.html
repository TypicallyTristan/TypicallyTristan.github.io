    <h1>Studying for 10/8/2024</h1>

    <p>Today I mainly focused on finishing the RAM module for Mike Meyer's course. I leanred quite a bit about RAM so here are all the notes that I took. Unfortunatley I didn't do any of googles cybersecurity course.</p>
        
        <p>Virtual memory is a portion of mass storage that acts as memory. VRAM is made from using a little bit of the hard drive to act like memory. We don't want to be using this. Ideally you should have enough RAM. Automatically manage paging file size for all drives is the part of the hard drive that manages the vram. You don't use all vram at default. All operating systems have tools to adjust virtual memory use. In most cases we just let the OS automatically control virtual memory. It grows when necessary. swap file = virtual memory</p>
        
        <p>Built into every RAM stick is a Serial Presence Detect (SPD) chip. This is the tiny chip on the RAM stick. This chip allows us to query the ram stick to find out all sorts of information about it. To do this the program CPU- Z is recommended.</p>
        
        
        <p>SO-DIMM (Small outline dual inline memory module.). For SO-DIMM RAM sticks, DDR and DDR2 do not have a set pin amount. Only DDR3 and DDR4 have a set one being, 204, and 260 respectively.</p>
            
        <p>If you see a RAM stick with 9 chips you're looking at ECC (Error Correction Code) RAM. This type of RAM is very expensive and meant for certain motherboards. The additional chip acts a bother an error detection chip and an extra chip in case another one is faulty. Parity and ECC RAM contain extra chips to check for RAM errors. ECC RAM is only for motherboards that support it.</p>
        
        
        <p>RAM should be identical capacity in the same channel. It is very important to put identical ram in any one channel. Double-sided RAM is actually 2x faster than the previous one. Since the inside of a ram is based on a square, doubling the ram speed is essentially making it 4x faster than the previous one</p>
        

        <p>DDR4 has 288 pins, DDR3 has 240, DDR2 has 240, and DDR has 184. The PC speed rating is the DDR speed rating x8. Only SD Ramsticks have two notches.</p>
